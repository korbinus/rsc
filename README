RSC, ReSource Compression, is a very small PHP script which aims to compress on 
the fly your JS and CSS files for a faster download. It is intended to be used 
when your web hosting company doesn't allow you to use mod_deflate in Apache 
(although you hopefully have compression available in the PHP configuration).

This was initially developed for circumventing these hinders I experienced 
while developing my pet project, geo:truc (http://www.geotruc.net)

It is especially useful when used with hosted libraries, for instance jQuery. 
Suppose you have a javascript directory name js/ and within it a file jQuery.js.

Instead of making a link such as:
<script src="js/jQuery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
where nothing is compressed, or using PHP for compressing and writing:
<script src="js/compress.php?file=jQuery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
you simply write
<script src="rsc/jQuery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
(the real file ISN'T in rsc/)

RSC will then find js/jQuery.js and send it over the Internet, but compressed.

How to use this? Simply copy the directories rsc/ and src/ to your site. You can
then edit rsc.htaccess and src/rsc.php to adapt the small configuration to your needs, and then 
start to use RSC.
